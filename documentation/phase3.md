# Phase 3: Backend API & Data Persistence

**Objective:**
Build and integrate the backend API for product management, ensuring data persistence, validation, and synchronization with the frontend.

## Deliverables
- Node.js/Express backend server
- RESTful API endpoints for products (CRUD)
- Database integration (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
- Data validation and error handling
- Sync endpoint for offline data
- API documentation

## Tasks Completed
- Set up Express server in the `server` folder
- Created RESTful API endpoints for products: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Integrated PostgreSQL/MongoDB for persistent data storage
- Implemented data validation and error handling in controllers
- Developed `/api/sync` endpoint for syncing offline changes from the client
- Connected frontend to backend API for all product operations
- Tested all endpoints using PowerShell, Postman, and the client UI

**Result:**
The backend API is fully functional, persistent, and integrated with the frontend. All product data is reliably stored, retrieved, and synchronized between client and server, supporting both online and offline workflows.
