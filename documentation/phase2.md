# Phase 2: Frontend MVP (with Backend Integration)

**Objective:**
Develop the core user interface as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support and product management features, fully integrated with the backend API.

## Deliverables
- React PWA scaffolded
- Product entry and listing UI
- State management with Zustand
- Barcode scanning integration
- Service worker for offline support
- Backend API integration for all product operations

## Tasks Completed
- Scaffolded React app in the `client` folder
- Implemented Zustand store for product state management, now using backend API for all CRUD operations
- Created ProductEntry and ProductList components for adding and displaying products, now fully integrated with backend
- Integrated barcode scanning using `react-barcode-reader`
- Registered a service worker for offline capabilities
- Ensured the app can add, list, and remove products, scan barcodes, and work offline
- Product data is now persistent and synced with the backend database
- Added support for syncing offline changes with the backend using the `/api/sync` endpoint

**Note:**
All product data in phase 2 is managed through the backend API implemented in phase 3. The frontend does not store product data locally; instead, it relies on the backend for all CRUD operations, ensuring data persistence, consistency, and synchronization across devices.
