# Phase 4: Sales Tracking & Reporting

**Objective:**
Expand the application to support sales tracking, reporting, and analytics for shop owners, providing insights into inventory movement and business performance.

## Deliverables
- Sales entry and listing UI in the frontend
- Backend API endpoints for sales (CRUD)
- Sales data persistence in the database
- Basic sales reports (total sales, sales by product, date range filtering)
- UI for viewing sales history and reports
- Integration of sales with inventory (reduce product quantity on sale)

## Tasks Completed
- Added sales entry and listing components to the React frontend
- Implemented sales state management and API integration
- Created Express routes and controllers for sales operations
- Linked sales creation to automatic inventory updates
- Developed endpoints and queries for generating basic sales reports
- Built UI for viewing sales history and simple analytics (e.g., total sales, best-selling products)
- Tested sales features end-to-end (UI, API, database)

**Result:**
Shop owners can now record sales, view sales history, and access basic business analytics. Inventory is automatically updated with each sale, and sales data is persistent and reportable.
