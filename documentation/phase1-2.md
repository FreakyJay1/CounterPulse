# Project Documentation: Phase 1 & Phase 2

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

**Objective:**
Establish the foundation for the project by defining requirements, user stories, and setting up the technical environment.

### Deliverables
- Project requirements document
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Initial file structure and repository setup

### Tasks Completed
- Researched user needs and defined project requirements
- Chose the tech stack: React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), Zustand (state management), PostgreSQL (database)
- Initialized Git repository
- Created base folders for client and server
- Added documentation files (phases.md, user stories.md)

---

## Phase 2: Frontend MVP

**Objective:**
Develop the core user interface as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support and product management features.

### Deliverables
- React PWA scaffolded
- Product entry and listing UI
- State management with Zustand
- Barcode scanning integration
- Service worker for offline support

### Tasks Completed
- Scaffolded React app in the `client` folder
- Implemented Zustand store for product state management
- Created ProductEntry and ProductList components for adding and displaying products
- Integrated barcode scanning using `react-barcode-reader`
- Registered a service worker for offline capabilities
- Ensured the app can add, list, and remove products, scan barcodes, and work offline

---

**Result:**
By the end of phase 2, the project has a working React-based PWA where users can add products (with barcode scanning), view the product list, and use the app even when offline. This forms the foundation for further development in later phases.
